## *Extract data from spatial data*
The purpose of this tool is to download and compile daily and monthly weather data from PRISM Climate Data, maintained **[Origon State University](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/)** The PRISM model is *[Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/documents/pubs/2008intjclim_physiographicMapping_daly.pdf).* 

For daily and monthly weather data, the availavle variables are **Precipitation**, **Minimum temperature**, **Mean temperature**, **Maximum temperature**, **Minimum Vapor Pressure Deficit**, **Maximum Vapor Pressure Deficit**, and **Mean dewpoint temp.**
